# PGDDS Projects IIIT Bangalore

PG Diploma in Data Science from IIIT-Bangalore
==============================================

The 11-month online PG Diploma program, co-developed by IIIT Bangalore &amp; Upgrad, covers the depth and breadth of the subject in the form of interactive lectures, live sessions, assignments and real-time case studies, and a 3-month capstone project mentored by industry professionals.

Important Notes: 

[1]: This repository includes assignments, case studies, and the projects that I had worked on during my PG Diploma in Data Science. I've included the R-script, .sql files, .txt files with detailed comments and pdf files for consolidated presentations wherever applicable. The raw data files for few of the assignments, case study, and projects have been uploaded or provided as url to download wherever applicable, but not always.

[2]: If you are a current or future student of the PGDDS program offered by IIIT-Bangalore. I encourage you to ask questions and ask for clarifications. However, I strongly discourage you from integrating sections of the code for your submissions. Every submission is evaluated by a plagiarism checker. A handful of students from my cohort have been penalized for indulging in such activities.
